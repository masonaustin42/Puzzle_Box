# Puzzle Box

This puzzle box was created for my brother's bachelor party. The box displays a basic map on the LEDs on top, using a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller and an Arduino compatible GPS receiver. 
The map updates in real-time, and helped navigate to different challenges that my brother had to complete to earn the codes to each of the different locks on the side of the box. The box cannot open until all 8 locks have been removed.
This project took about a month to develop, and it was made entirely from scratch aside from using some Arduino libraries to control the LEDs and interface with the GPS unit.
